        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <b>D2DraftNet</b> is a machine learning model designed to predict the outcome of Dota 2 matches based on hero drafts. The model utilizes <b>embeddings</b> to transform a hero draft into a vector representation in an abstract embedding space, which is then processed by a deep neural network (DNN) for training and inference.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
			<li>The draft of each team (Radiant & Dire) is represented as a binary vector.</li>
			<li>This vector is passed through an <b>embedding layer</b>, which maps each hero pick to a 
			low-dimensional numerical representation. </li> 
			<li>A <b>Deep Neural Network (DNN)</b> processes this embedding, learning complex interactions 
				between hero picks.</li>  
			<li>The model outputs a win probability for the Radiant team.</li>
        </ul>

		<h2>Data Acquisition</h2>
        <p>
			The data acquisition process involves scraping match data from the <b>OpenDota</b> API. 
			Use the pub data api call (forget the name but if you look through the options it should be obvious.
        </p>
        <p>
				Data is stored in a <b>Parquet</b> (think the name is something like that) file.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
			<li>Enhance dataset size for better generalization.</li>
        </ul>
